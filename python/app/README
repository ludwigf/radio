This application presents a fairly complete audio signal generator. It allows to 
mix up to four common wave forms as well as a form of noise. Shape, frequency, 
and amplitudes of signals and noise are configurable.

Apart from straight audio output, output to a UDP socket as well as raw GNU
Radio compatible file and wave file output are supported.

The application depends on wxPython, GNU Radio, and psutils. It has been tested 
only on Kubuntu 12.10.
