NOTE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each application contains a small starter script (the one without an extension)
that amends the PYHTONPATH and sets up the proper startup environment. For an
app to work correctly, this script has to be edited to properly reflect where
in the local file system the app has been installed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a (rudimentary?) app to experiment with filters acting on audio spectrum
signals. Input may come from a microphone connected to the computer's sound 
card, from raw data files as generated by other GNU Radio apps, or from a UDP
socket that receives raw GNU Radio generated data.

Signals are processed through a chain of user defined filters (currently, low
pass, high pass, band pass, and band reject). The processed signal is displayed
in Scope, FFT, and waterfall views, and optionally can be played back to the
sound card's speaker output (watch the feedback loops).

The application depends on wxPython, GNU Radio, and psutils. It has been tested 
only on Kubuntu 12.10.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This application presents a fairly complete audio signal generator. It allows to 
mix up to four common wave forms as well as a form of noise. Shape, frequency, 
and amplitudes of signals and noise are configurable.

Apart from straight audio output, output to a UDP socket as well as raw GNU
Radio compatible file and wave file output are supported.

The application depends on wxPython, GNU Radio, and psutils. It has been tested 
only on Kubuntu 12.10.
